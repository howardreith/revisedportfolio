                                <p>What do Samuel L. Jackson and Fred Rogers have in common?</p>

                                <p>Consider Pulp Fiction. Jackson bursts into an apartment portraying a murderous hitman
                                    who emphatically quotes the Bible before raining his wrath upon his victim. Now
                                    think about Fred Rogers singing “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”</p>

                                <p>These two performances are worlds apart. They have entirely different emotions. Yet
                                    both have a certain magnetism, the power to provoke a strong reaction in their
                                    audiences. </p>

                                <p>What’s at work here? What makes these performances so effective?</p>

                                <p>Charisma.</p>

                                <h3>What is charisma?</h3>

                                <p>I’ve worked for years to identify a clear, actionable definition of charisma. It’s
                                    not easy.</p>

                                <p>Some people believe it’s a magnetic quality you are born with -- you either have it,
                                    or you don’t. Others believe it’s a combination of personality traits. Even in
                                    science, we can find a measurable consensus between people as to whether someone is
                                    charismatic, but if you ask those same people what makes that person so, they’ll
                                    disagree.[1]</p>

                                <p>People want to place hard rules on what charisma is or isn’t, but I don’t find that
                                    helpful. It can’t be defined like eye color or weight. It’s an emotional reaction.
                                    It’s how you make other people feel. And like any emotional reaction, it will always
                                    depend on <i>context</i>.</p>

                                <p><b>What I do know is that charisma involves social power.</b></p>

                                <p>This means you are someone whom others view as competent or influential enough to
                                    make things happen. They feel you have their best interests at heart. They trust you
                                    and feel fondly toward you.</p>

                                <p>Most of the time, people make these judgments based on subtle cues like your attire,
                                    behavior, or body language. And they also base it on the topic of this article: your
                                    voice.</p>

                                <h3>The imperfect science behind charisma</h3>

                                <p>What makes a radio announcer appealing to listen to? What distinguishes a good speech
                                    from a bad one? And how do we learn to harness the non-verbal messages we’re
                                    sending?</p>

                                <p>Whenever I advocate for a course of action, I do my best to back my recommendations
                                    with science. With charisma though, we have a problem. Science is built on
                                    reproducibility. Charisma is aesthetic.</p>

                                <p>It can be difficult for multiple studies to reproduce the same contexts between
                                    experiments. Even when they can, the people will be different. Social psychology is
                                    fraught with confounding variables and tenuous connections, and it’s hard to draw
                                    concrete conclusions.</p>

                                <p>For example, if I were to do a study that found a definitive correlation between
                                    speaking loudly and positive audience responses, could we conclude that speaking
                                    louder is more charismatic?</p>

                                <p>That might be the case in the context of a TED Talk, but could we apply that finding
                                    to intimately flirting with your lover? Probably not. Would this disprove the
                                    premise? Not necessarily – we just need more context.</p>

                                <h3>Get some depth</h3>

                                <p>If you look into the science on charisma you’ll quickly come across this idea called
                                    prosody. Prosody is an amalgamation of many factors, but the most impactful for our
                                    concerns are pitch, rhythm, and volume. Of these, pitch is the most important.</p>

                                <p>There’s evidence to show that for men, <b>speaking with a lower pitch provides a
                                    charismatic advantage.</b> Men who speak with lower voices tend to come across as
                                    more
                                    confident, respectable, and sexy.</p>

                                <p>In a study examining spontaneous social ranks formed in groups, speaking in lower
                                    tones during first interactions was associated with higher social status. This
                                    suggests that the way we pitch our voice may be a subtle non-verbal way we rank
                                    ourselves relative to each other.[2]</p>

                                <p>In other studies, listeners rated deeper voices as stronger and more masculine, and
                                    men who perceived themselves as stronger instinctively deepened their voices when in
                                    competitive contexts.[3] Women also appear to find men who speak in low tones more
                                    attractive, at least when ovulating.[4]</p>

                                <p>While reading these results, you might be wondering if the same applies to women. Do
                                    women come across as more confident when they speak in lower voices as well? </p>

                                <p>Yes and no. There is evidence that vocal fry, the lowest, gravelly register of the
                                    voice, conveys a sense of incompetence and undependability when used by women.[5]
                                    However, one study found that women who spoke in lower tones came across as more
                                    competent and charismatic than those who did not.[6] This would suggest that there
                                    is some benefit to speaking in a lower pitch, but only if it’s supported well enough
                                    to not enter vocal fry.</p>

                                <p>So generally speaking, for both sexes, having a lower “base pitch,” is probably
                                    advantageous.</p>

                                <h3>Change it up</h3>

                                <p>More important than the overall pitch of one’s speaking voice is the variation in
                                    your pitch as you speak. Researchers at the MIT Media Lab were able to predict the
                                    outcome of a sales call with 87% accuracy based on nothing but the frequency of
                                    modulation of a salesman’s voice and the ratio between listening and speaking. The
                                    more they varied their pitch, and the more they listened, the more likely they got a
                                    sale.[7]</p>

                                <p>In studies examining the speeches of politicians, those who had wide and varied
                                    ranges of pitch were perceived as more “charismatic” and “lively.”[8] An analysis of
                                    Steve Jobs’ speaking suggested that varying one’s pitch “melodically” is one of the
                                    most impactful techniques you can use.[9] Indeed, most studies agree that having a
                                    varied, animated way of speaking is more appealing than the alternative.[10] </p>

                                <p><b>Perhaps it’s not low or high voices that are appealing, but the freedom of a
                                    speaker to modulate their voice how they see fit.</b></p>

                                <p>Before closing out on pitch, there’s one final factor to cover: the “high rising
                                    terminal.” If your voice rises in pitch at the ends of your sentences, it comes
                                    across as insecure.[11] Linguist Robin Lakoff suggests that it’s a signal of
                                    subordination.[12] Unless you’re asking a question, when it comes to ending your
                                    sentences, always cadence them evenly or downward in pitch.</p>

                                <h3>Talk slower and louder, mostly</h3>

                                <p>Nearly as important as pitch is the tempo of your speech.</p>

                                <p>Carmine Gallo, author of <i>Talk Like TED</i>, suggests that speaking at a rate of
                                    190 words
                                    per minute is optimal for public speaking. This is slower than most people are
                                    accustomed to. Effective use of pauses has a tremendous effect on the perception of
                                    a speech.[13]</p>

                                <p>But keep in mind the flexibility of your tempo makes the most difference, not the
                                    mere arithmetic average speed.</p>

                                <p>In general, it’s stronger to speak clearly and pace yourself. But if your message is
                                    energetic, you’ll want to be speaking more quickly. If your message is solemn, a
                                    slower pace is called for.</p>

                                <p><b>When it comes to volume, the research is clear. Louder is better.</b>[14] Hundreds
                                    of
                                    years of theatre practices are correct after all; it’s better to project with a
                                    loud, clear voice. A full voice is a confident voice.</p>

                                <h3>Cut the filler and add a smile</h3>

                                <p>As mentioned, adding pauses can have a powerful effect on your speaking, and nowhere
                                    is this more the case than when done in place of “filler” sounds like “uh” and “um.”
                                    Dropping such tics from your speech has a measurable effect on your perceived
                                    charisma.[15] If you replace them with a slightly slower rate of speech and a few
                                    pauses, you’ll be better off.</p>

                                <p>Lastly, if you add a hint of a smile into your expression while talking, it will go a
                                    long way to making your tone come across warmer. People can detect a smile even over
                                    the phone,[16] and one study suggested that coming across happier in your first
                                    “hello” can have a substantial impact on the rest of the interaction.[17]</p>

                                <p><b>To summarize, conveying confidence with your voice is best accomplished by:</b>
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Deepening the tone of your voice.</li>
                                    <li>Varying the pitch, rhythm, and volume of your speech. In general, slow down,
                                        speak louder, and leave room for pauses.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Dropping or maintaining your pitch at the ends of your sentences.</li>
                                    <li>Eliminating filler words such as “um” and “uh.”</li>
                                    <li>Adding the hint of a smile to your face.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Develop your awareness, not memorization</h3>

                                <p>There’s an infinite number of ways to “vary the pitch” of our voices. If I start
                                    talking with each successive word pitched at a different note, am I going to come
                                    across as more charismatic? Of course not.</p>

                                <p><b>Where charisma truly lies is in our familiarity with the language and cultural
                                    context of the words we’re saying.</b> This helps us emphasize and de-emphasize our
                                    speech depending on the message we wish to convey. </p>

                                <p>So we need to develop an understanding of the social implications of the ways we
                                    project our voices.</p>

                                <p>Instead of trying to manufacture a voice that superficially hits the above bullet
                                    points, I encourage you to focus on:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Maximizing your physical vocal ability so you can freely express yourself as you
                                        like.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Developing your social awareness so you can convey the right messages.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>This isn’t about conforming to guidelines; this is about freedom. </p>

                                <p>You want to have the physical ability and social awareness necessary to be versatile
                                    and deliberate in your communication. I don’t want you to become a robot that speaks
                                    within a set of programmed criteria.</p>

                                <p> For starters, learn to breathe properly. This is a topic I can and will talk about
                                    at
                                    length in follow-ups to this article, but for now, look into low,
                                    <a target="_blank"
                                       href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diaphragmatic-breathing#benefits">
                                        diaphragmatic breathing.
                                    </a>
                                    Experiment speaking in very high and very low pitches so you can
                                    modulate however you need to. Practice speaking both more slowly and more quickly so
                                    you can use the tempo of your speech, and silences, to your advantage. </p>

                                <h3>Get out and read between the lines</h3>

                                <p>The freer you are, the more capable a communicator you will become. But once you are
                                    able to use your voice how you like, you need to know <i>what</i> to express.</p>

                                <p><b>There is no substitute for going out, interacting with other people, and listening
                                    attentively to how they communicate.</b> You need to build that emotional
                                    intelligence
                                    through experience. You must be a scholar of the culture around you.</p>

                                <p>As you watch speeches, go to parties, and chat with your friends, pay attention to
                                    non-verbal cues they’re sending. Read between the lines. Listen to the underlying
                                    social implications in what they say.</p>

                                <p>Watch: Are they annoyed? Happy? Attracted to someone? How do they say “hi” to their
                                    friends? To someone creeping them out? To their lovers? What can you tell from the
                                    way they are saying things?</p>

                                <p>Actively listen and think about these subtleties. When you get home, write down what
                                    you learned. It may seem odd to study social interactions so deliberately, but this
                                    is how you develop more social awareness.</p>

                                <p>For example, let’s imagine I watched someone telling a funny story to his friends. “I
                                    noticed he started off slow and low-pitched, but the closer he got to the climax,
                                    the higher and louder his voice got and the faster he talked.”</p>

                                <p>Ultimately, you want to be able to recognize and practice these non-verbal
                                    communication skills intuitively, but the path involves conscious study and
                                    practice. </p>

                                <h3>This is charisma</h3>

                                <p>When Mr. Rogers comes on screen inviting you to be his neighbor, his voice is soft,
                                    slow, and friendly. He smiles. He comes across as trustworthy and sincere, like the
                                    only thing he wants in his whole life is to spend more time with you.</p>

                                <p>When Samuel L. Jackson portrays Jules Winnfield, he’s loud, his voice is
                                    high-pitched, and he speaks quickly. The emotion he conveys is different, but the
                                    fundamental elements are the same. He is direct. His voice is full. He means what he
                                    says.</p>

                                <p>These are the true elements of charisma.</p>

                                <p>The flexibility in vocal power, the understanding of emotional and social context,
                                    the sincerity, and in their combination the ability to convey the messages you want
                                    to convey. This is the difference between a bland and a compelling speech, whether
                                    it’s to an audience of 10,000 or a bedtime story to your child.</p>

                                <p>I’ll follow up with videos illustrating some of these concepts in greater depth. It
                                    is, after all, easier to talk about the voice when I have my own to use.</p>

                                I'm Howie, a software engineer, singer, and author. I'm passionate about
                                self-improvement,
                                learning, and writing quality code. In my free time you'll find me rock climbing,
                                dancing, or doing improv comedy. Thanks for checking out my content.

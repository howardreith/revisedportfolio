                                        here

                                <p>For two years I’d had a crush on her. She was beautiful, smart, a talented dancer,
                                    and living down the street from me to boot. All of my friends—hell, most of the
                                    school—knew about my feelings. They’d been trying to get me to ask her out, and I’d
                                    decided the moment had come. It was the night of our eighth-grade end-of-the-year
                                    social, and I resolved to ask her to dance. After two hours of talking myself into
                                    it, I walked up to her and…froze. I couldn’t do it. The anxiety was too extreme. My
                                    buddy, who’d been watching, wasn’t going to let me get away with that. He snuck up,
                                    tapped her on the shoulder, and ran away, spurring her to turn and face me. I was
                                    surprised, but blurted out, “You want to dance?” Her reply was instant.
                                    “Nooooooooooooooooooooo!”</p>

                                <p>It was my first rejection—the first of hundreds. I sulked for the next couple of
                                    days, but on the third day, as I sat in art class, I made myself a promise. “This
                                    isn’t how my story’s going to end.” I know, melodramatic, huh? “From this day on, I
                                    will do everything I can to become the most attractive man I can be until I’m thirty
                                    years old.” Why thirty? I don’t know. It seemed far off at the time, and I figured
                                    I’d get married by then. (Funny to think about, now that I’m twenty-nine….)</p>

                                <p>Fortunately for me, I followed through. Every year since, I’ve done my best to learn
                                    about dating, relationships, and becoming more attractive. I asked my female friends
                                    what they liked in guys, I tried out new fashions and hobbies, and I started working
                                    out. Later on, I began studying psychology, self-help, and anything else remotely
                                    relevant I could get my hands on. Most of my early efforts were misguided, but every
                                    year, without fail, I had more success than the year before. I went from the
                                    “creepy” guy in high school to a guy who intrigued pretty much every woman he met.
                                    In recent years, I’ve never lacked sexual companions, and today, I’m in a
                                    relationship that makes me happier than I’ve ever been.</p>

                                <p>Around the age of twenty-three, I made a discovery. Trying to “be attractive” is
                                    actually a pretty damn unattractive thing to do. Attraction is something other
                                    people feel toward you, not something you do, so when you’re trying to “be
                                    attractive,” you’re looking to warp other people’s perceptions. It’s manipulative,
                                    and when women realize you’re doing it, they find it creepy. I learned that you
                                    can’t control how anyone sees you, or whether anyone likes you, and you shouldn’t
                                    try. All you can control is how you see yourself—and whether or not you ask out the
                                    women you like. Attractiveness isn’t something you can work to have; it’s something
                                    you develop as a side effect of living an interesting life. Once I understood that,
                                    the way forward became clear. I needed to learn to be direct, authentic, and
                                    comfortable with dating, and doing that was just a matter of removing the obstacles
                                    on that path. My biggest barriers were a lack of confidence in myself and a lack of
                                    social skills. If I could address those problems, I figured I’d be golden, and I was
                                    right. Of course, those weren’t exactly small problems to solve.</p>

                                <p>You’ve picked up this book looking for dating advice, and if you’re anything like I
                                    was, you’ve pored over endless volumes on this subject and found most of them to be
                                    bullshit. Perhaps you’ve delved into the seduction community, or the work of “alpha
                                    male” evangelists, or the books on achieving dating success through various
                                    spiritual movements. Maybe you’ve just had friends offering you platitudes such as
                                    “Be yourself.” You’re frustrated, and you’re probably wondering if The Guyde will be
                                    more of the same.</p>

                                <p>I never expected to give dating advice. It’s something I more or less stumbled into
                                    when I started answering questions about dating on the Q&A website Quora. I began
                                    answering those questions out of boredom, but after several months, hundreds of
                                    people were telling me how my advice had changed their lives. My writing got
                                    published in the Huffington Post, Time, Lifehacker, Thought Catalog, and elsewhere.
                                    People kept asking me where to learn everything I had to say, and all I could do was
                                    give them a long reading list, each item of which was only partially applicable to
                                    their needs. I was encouraged to write a book that focused on the most important
                                    lessons, so I have. I’ve designed this book to be the resource I wish I had had when
                                    I was younger, and I’ve tried to keep it free of all the shit that annoys me most
                                    about the dating-advice industry and the self-help genre. This book is structured
                                    around problems, solutions, explanations, and exercises that put those solutions
                                    into practice. Everything I recommend is based on scientific research, mostly in the
                                    fields of cognitive therapy, social psychology, and couples therapy. You will find
                                    no misguided appeals to the “Law of Attraction,” pop evolutionary psychology,
                                    neurolinguistic programming, or any such pseudoscience. I also offer references for
                                    everything I suggest, so if you care to look into why I recommend what I do, you can
                                    read any of my sources for yourself.</p>

                                <h3>Who is this book for?</h3>

                                <p>I wrote this book for heterosexual guys who’d like to have more success in dating,
                                    but the truth is, most of the insights I’m sharing can help anyone in any sort of
                                    relationship. Do you freak out about how people judge you? Are you depressed because
                                    you think you’ll be alone forever, and that depression keeps you from dating? Do you
                                    have bitter, misogynistic views? Are you stinky? This book will help with all of
                                    that and more. I also hope that when you finish this book, dating success will be
                                    the least of the benefits you enjoy. It’s not a guide to getting laid; it’s a guide
                                    to becoming the best version of yourself, and that entails a lot of personal changes
                                    that are incredibly beneficial in their own right. Yes, women will love you, but
                                    more important than that, you’ll love yourself.</p>

                                <h3>The Guyde Approach</h3>

                                <p>There are no pickup lines or routines in The Guyde. Since the root of most men’s
                                    dating struggles lies in our own self-limiting ways of thinking, the most important
                                    component of this book is a collection of clinically effective techniques to address
                                    self-defeating thoughts. You will learn how to deal with shame, low self-esteem,
                                    fear, laziness, and bad habits.</p>

                                <p>The next big issue most men face is a lack of social skills. We will discuss at
                                    length the mechanisms underlying social interactions as understood by psychologists.
                                    The Guyde will teach you to be socially aware and adept. You will be capable of
                                    mustering confidence, sensitivity, humor, and sexuality as needed.</p>

                                <p>With these first two sections alone, you will enjoy more dating success than anyone
                                    you know, but we’re not stopping there. While looks are nowhere near so important as
                                    your self-esteem and personality, we’ll also talk about how to improve your physical
                                    appearance through hygiene, grooming, and fashion, and discuss the most clinically
                                    effective approaches to diet and exercise.</p>

                                <p>The fourth section will talk about actual dating. You’ll learn how to meet women,
                                    flirt, plan dates, kiss, cuddle, and be good in bed. We’ll talk about common
                                    problems in long-term relationships, both monogamous and casually sexual. Every
                                    chapter will have exercises to help ingrain the lessons into your personality. Some
                                    of these exercises will be one-time things, some will be ongoing, some will need to
                                    be done in specific circumstances, and some will require a partner. Only you can
                                    know what exercises will benefit you most, and you will need to design your own
                                    personal schedule and “workouts” to practice and improve. The last chapter will give
                                    you an example of how to do this, and you’re welcome to visit <a target="_blank"

                                <h3>How to read this book</h3>

                                <p>This book isn’t a collection of fluffy anecdotes to make you feel inspired while
                                    you’re taking a dump; it’s a cross between a handbook and a textbook, and it’s
                                    extensive. You’re going to have to study, practice, and take notes. Don’t try to
                                    make all your changes at once, or you’ll be overwhelmed.</p>

                                <p>Here’s how I suggest you go about the program. Read through this book once. At the
                                    end of each chapter, there are exercises labeled “Immediate.” Do these exercises as
                                    soon as you finish a chapter. Ignore the rest. After you’ve finished the book, when
                                    you have a solid idea of what your biggest issues are, look back through the
                                    exercises and focus on ones from the chapters you’re most concerned with. “One Time”
                                    exercises are meant to be performed once. “Ongoing” exercises require extended
                                    practice. “Responsive” exercises should be performed in the specified circumstances.
                                    “Partner” exercises are done with a partner. Incorporate the exercises you find most
                                    valuable into your daily routine, but take your time doing so. Remember, you’re
                                    human. You’re not going to change overnight, and there are only so many changes you
                                    can make at once. Your transformation will take months and could take a couple of
                                    years. However long it takes you, The Guyde will help you all along the way, and if
                                    you’re struggling, you can always ask for help at <a target="_blank"
                                            href="../index.html">howiereith.com/guyde</a>
                                    .</p>

                                <p>While you’re reading, you might sometimes wonder why I’m asking you to learn a
                                    particular skill. For example, in chapter 2, we’re going to talk a lot about
                                    “talking back to your inner critic.” You might be confused about how this technique
                                    applies to dating, but then, three weeks later, when you’re making your first
                                    approach and your brain starts to flood with thoughts such as “She won’t want to
                                    talk to me, she won’t find me attractive,” that’s when you’ll realize, “Oh shit,
                                    this is what he was talking about,” and you’ll know how to deal with it. Likewise,
                                    you might not know how “habit-reversal therapy” applies to dating, but when you
                                    start taking a look at your posture and you realize, “Whenever I walk, I hunch my
                                    shoulders,” that’s when the tool will make sense. Every word in this book has a
                                    purpose, so if something doesn’t make sense, just keep reading; its value will
                                    become clear later on.</p>

                                <p>The Guyde is a labor of love. I remember the pain and loneliness I went through, and
                                    how powerless I felt to change things. I remember my frustration when all the advice
                                    I could find was manipulative and misogynistic. I wanted to write a book that would
                                    help everyone who struggles as I did. Despite what you may have been told, you don’t
                                    have to be a “bad boy” or practice dozens of routines to date women. You just need
                                    to learn how to be the most authentic, confident version of yourself. There are
                                    women out there who will want you, eagerly. I hope this book helps you find
                                    them.</p>

                                dancing, or doing improv comedy. Thanks for checking out my content.
